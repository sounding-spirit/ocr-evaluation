<td><font style="background-color:aquamarine">INTRODUCTORY </font>On the 8th day of September, 1906, the United Sacred Harp Musical Association, in Atlanta, Ga., passed resolutions, directing the appoint- ment of a committee on the revision of the Sacred Harp. This com- mittee was appointed and proceeded with the work specified in the resolutions, but was hindered in one way and another from carrying out the resolutions above mentioned. Several attempts have been made within the last two or three years to revise the Sacred Harp by others, but the work was done in such a way this committee could not endorse and accept the same, although their names are attached to some of these books as endorsing them. This, however,<font style="background-color:aquamarine"> </font>is without authority by the members of the committee. The endorsement could not be made because the revisors of these volumes did not comply with the resolu- tions under which the committee was appointed, and after all efforts to get a book published as specified and required in the resolutions had failed, and no prospect of getting a publication in accordance with the resolutions, the committee proceeded last February to make and compile what they have christened the <span id="l1146.1133" onmouseout="document.getElementById('r1146.1133').style.background='none'" onmouseover="document.getElementById('r1146.1133').style.background='greenyellow'" title="&lsquo;"><font color="red">"</font></span>Original Sacred Harp.<span id="l1168.1156" onmouseout="document.getElementById('r1168.1156').style.background='none'" onmouseover="document.getElementById('r1168.1156').style.background='greenyellow'" title="&rsquo;"><font color="red">"</font></span> A brief statement of the work performed is in part as follows: 1.

In all tunes which could not be improved by adding alto, it has been left out. Notwithstanding this, alto has been composed and added to number of tunes and composed in the same harmony as the other parts in such a way as to greatly improve the melody of each and all the tunes. These, alto are unlike those other books. Dispersed Harmony has been adhered to and the alto is in perfect accord with the other parts of the music. 4<span id="l2074.2059" onmouseout="document.getElementById('r2074.2059').style.background='none'" onmouseover="document.getElementById('r2074.2059').style.background='greenyellow'" title=","><font color="red">.</font></span> More words, or verses, of the same hymn have been added to a large number of the church tunes, in most cases, placed under the lines of the music so it can be easily sung or played, and when the tune has only one verse, it is generally put in the lower and upper spaces of the tune, in many them under the different parts, where it is necessary to do so. 5. At the top of the page the key is stated, in addition to the sharps and flats. 6. Following the name of the tune, the letters or figures which rep- <font style="background-color:aquamarine">p</font>resent the metre are placed. 7. Under the name of the tune is placed the scripture text upon which the words of the tune are founded, giving citation of the book, chapter and verse in the Bible. 8. In Fugue pieces of music, the lines of poetry have been generally placed under each of the parts of the music, so as to prevent confusion in rendering them. Prismas have been used in but few instances. 9. Corrections of words, in spelling, division of words in syllables, arranging and correcting them in many cases so as to get proper pro- nunciation and accent.

In some of them there are only changes of a few notes in the tunes, and on this, claim them as their own productions. In such cases, we have credited the original author wherever found.
