JEREMIAH INGALLS, 1805. 1. Grace! 'tis a charm-ing sound, Har-mo-nious to the ear; Heav'n with the ech - o shall re - sound, And all the earth shall hear. 2. Grace first con-trived the way To save re - bel - lious man; And all the steps that grace dis - play, Which drew the won-drous plan. 3. Grace taught my wan-d'ring feet To tread the heav'n-ly road; And new sup - plies each hour I meet, While press-ing on to God. 4. Grace all the work shall crown Through ev-er-last - ing days; It lays in heav'n the top - most stone, And well de - serves our praise. This hymn is on "<font style="background-color:aquamarine"> </font>Salvation by Grace," from the author's hymns, 1755. The original name of this tune was " Kentucky." Philip Doddridge, D. D., the author of the hymn, was born in London, 1702, over two hundred years ago. He was a scholar of high attainments; was ordained to the Nonconformist ministry; was an English Congregationalist, and for many years pastor of one of these churches, from 1829 to the time of his death, 1852. He was a great pulpit orator and theologian. He composed many standard hymns and high-class sacred music. See sketch of Jeremiah Ingalls under the tune " Northfield." He is the author of some of the best music of those who composed in his day, and many of his tunes are still popular with the church people, especially in the United States, and many of his best productions are in the leading tune and hymn books of to-day. This tune appears in Jeremiah Ingall's " Song Books," beginning 1805 to 1820; also in the " Southern Harmony," by Walker, 1835 and 1849, by same author; in the "<font style="background-color:aquamarine"> </font>Christian Harmony," 1866 and 1901. See " Missouri Harmony," page 31, 1837, and many other publications. Copyright, 1909, by J.S. James WEBSTER. S. M. ISAAC WATTS, 1707. Key of G Major. "If a man love me, he will keep my words." 1. Come we who love the Lord, And <font style="background-color:aquamarine">le</font>t our joys<font style="background-color:aquamarine"> be</font> known: Join in a song with sweet ac - ord And thus sur-round the throne. 2. Let those re - fuse to sing who nev - er knew our God; But serv-ants of the heav'n-ly King May speak their joys a - broad. 3. The God that rules on high, That all the earth sur - veys, That rides up - on the storm-y sky, And calms the roar - ing sea. This tune appears in "<font style="background-color:aquamarine"> </font>Southern Harmony," 1835, by William Walker, and many other sacred tune books prior to that time. The original name was "Heavenly Joys on Earth," appearing in Watts' " Hymns of Spiritual Songs." The author of the tune " Webster " is unknown, it having appeared in a large number of song books for the last sixty years without being credited to any one. There are certain claims, however, that it may have been written by Corelli. We think this is a mistake. The tune may have been taken from a melody by Handel, but there is no certainty about it.</td><td>PHILIP DODDRIDGE, 1735. Key of C Major<font style="background-color:aquamarine">. NINETY-THIRD PSALM.
