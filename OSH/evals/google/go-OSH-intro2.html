<td>have been published in the early song books of this country, all of which has caused tedious research and patience. The plan of writing sketches of authors and tunes has not been attempted heretofore by authors of music in connection with the tune, except the writer of this article. (See Union Harp and History of Songs published by him in 1909.) In that book there was a much smaller number of tunes. To write the sketch of each tune and print it, in connection with the music, is an expensive and arduous labor and undertaking that no author before has been willing to attempt or expend. However, it will greatly add to the interest of all tunes to know something of their composition and the history of the composer of the words and music, and much benefit gained in reading them by one knowing the <span id="l803.1493" onmouseout="document.getElementById('r803.1493').style.background='none'" onmouseover="document.getElementById('r803.1493').style.background='greenyellow'" title="s"><font color="red">c</font></span>our<span id="l807.1497" onmouseout="document.getElementById('r807.1497').style.background='none'" onmouseover="document.getElementById('r807.1497').style.background='greenyellow'" title="c"><font color="red">s</font></span>e from whence they came. 12.
