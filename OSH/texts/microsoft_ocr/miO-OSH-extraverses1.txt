PARTING HAND. L, M.

Key of G Major.
JEREMIAH INGALLS, 1803.
My Christian friends, in bonds of love, Whose hearts in sweetest union join, 2. Your company's sweet, your union dear,
Yet
Your friendship's like a drawing band, Yet we must take the parting hand.
Your words delightful to my ear
3• | How loath we are to leave the place Where Jesus shows his smil-ing face. j
f How sweet theÉhours have passed away Since we have met to sing and pray; 4. O could I stay with friends so kind,
But

duty makes me understand That we must take the parting hand.
4.
5 And since it is God's holy will,
We must be parted for a while,
In sweet submission, all as one,
We'll say, our Father's will be done.
6 My youthful friends, in Christian ties,
Who seek for mansions in the skies,
Fight on, we'll gain that happy shore,
Where parting will be known no more.
7 How oft I've seen your flowing tears,
And heard you tell your hopes and fears !
Your hearts with love were seen to flame,
Which makes me hope we'll meet again.
8 Ye mourning souls, lift up your eyes
To glorious mansions in the skies ;
O trust His grace—in Canaan's land
We'll no more take the parting hand.
How would it cheer my drooping mind!
9 And now, my friends, both old and young,
I hope in Christ you'll still go on ;
And if on earth we meet no more,
O may we meet on Canaan's shore.
10 1 hope you'll all remember me
If on earth no more I see ;
An interest in your prayers I crave,
That we meet beyond the grave.
11 0 glorious day! O blessed hope !
My soul leaps forward at the thought
When, on that happy, happy land,
We'll no more take the parting hand.
12 But with our blessed holy Lord
We'll shout and sing with one accord,
And there we'll all with Jesus dwell,
So, loving Christians, fare you well.
Jeremiah Ingalls was a native of the State of Massachusetts; born in 1764 and died in 1828. In 1804 he published a book called " Christian Harmony." The

Among some of the leading tunes of his are " Northfield " and " New Jerusalem." A more extended sketch of Mr. Ingalls is given under the tune of " North•
It may be that he wrote the words to " Parting Hand," as well as the music. He usually wrote the words to his own tunes.
