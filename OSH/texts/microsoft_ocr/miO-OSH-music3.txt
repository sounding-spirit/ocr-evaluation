Samuel Stennett was one of the most influential and highly respected ministers of the Dissenting persuasion in England, and was a confidant of many of the
distinguished statesmen of his time. Doctor of Divinity was bestowed upon him by the Aberdeen University. He composed and published thirty-eight hymns.
Beside this, he wrote and published theological works. He died in London in 1795.
Nothing is known of C. F. Letson, the person to whom credit is given as being the author of this tune. No trace can be obtained when he composed it.
