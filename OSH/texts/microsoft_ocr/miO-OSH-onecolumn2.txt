STATEMENT AND ENDORSEMENT BY THE COMMITTEE ON REVISION or THE SACRED HARP, APPOINTED BY THE
UNITED SACRED HARP MUSICAL ASSOCIATION.
After much unnecessary delay and hindrance, we have sueeeeded in having under our supervision a final and complete revision of the Sacred Harp,
as provided in the resolutions under which this Committee was appointed, and hereby submit the following pages embodied in this volume of rudi-
ments and tunes, believing that the "Original Sacred Harp" now contains, as here presented, the best and most extended collection of valuable sacred
tunes and hymns ever published in this country. There is nothing like it on the market.
Tt is believed by the Committee it is what the singing public demands and the country for a long time has needed. No revision made by others
has been satisfactory to this Committee in such a way as we could give them our endorsements and keep within the bounds directed in the resolutions
above referred to. We have followed in this compilation, the letter, spirit and reason of the resolutions. We give the work herein contained, our
undivided commendation and endorsement, and believe it will be well pleasing to the music people, and the medium of spreading Christian tunes and
hymns so much needed in all the country, and will be the means of build ing up and reviving the spiritual condition of the churches. Most of the
work of compiling the book has been done by a sub-committee, appointed from the general committee, but under the supervision of the entire com-
mittee. For detailed statement of the work performed, we refer to the in troduction of the book by J. S. James, our Chairman, and advise every one
to read it, and see the value of the work done under the supervision of this committee.
Respectfully submitted,
