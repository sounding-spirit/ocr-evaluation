The original title to this hymn was "Christ, the Sinner's Way to God." John Cennick was born in England in 1718. He joined the Methodist societies of

hymnics. The last named has found its way into the hymn books of the American churches. Alto by S. M. Denson, 1911.
This tune is credited to William Walker (about 1832). See " Southern Harmony," by him, page 1I, 1835; "Christian Harmony," by same author, page 207,
1866. The tune in its present form was arranged by Mr. Walker, but the author is unknown.
