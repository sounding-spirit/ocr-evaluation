5 This woman she was taken
From near to Adam's heart,
And she must be protected
From injury and harm.
By which we are directed
fore a bride was form - ed, Or a - ny mate was found.
That they should never part.
10 This woman was not taken
The book that's called the Bible,
From Adam's feet, we see ;
Be sure you don't neglect ;
And she must not be abused,
For in every sense of duty,
The meaning seems to be.
It will you both direct.
II The husband is commanded
To love his loving bride ;

And live as does a Christian,
To do her husband's will
And for his house provide.

Her duty to fulfill.

Her husband to obey,

Not sow the seed of strife,

These are the solemn duties
From under Adam's arm ;
Of every man and wife.
See other sketches of Edmund Dumas, the author of the above tune. This tune was written and named Edmonds for Eld. Edmonds who helped to revise the
"Sacred Harp" in 1859. It was put in the place of the tune "Creation," removed in 1859. We cannot find when the words were first published. Mr. Edmonds
taught music with E. T. Pounds. He lived in Monroe county, Georgia, and died in that county when he was over sixty years old, 1884.
