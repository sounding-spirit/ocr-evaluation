Key of G Major.
" A friend loveth at all times."-PROV. 17 : 17.
I.
Dear friends, farewell! I do you tell, Since you and I must part; ) Your love to me has been most free,
How can I bear to jour-ney where
I go away and here you stay, But still were joined in heart.
Your conversation sweet;
With you I cannot meet!
2 Yet do I find my heart inclined
3 I trust you'll pray, both night and day,
4 If I'm called home whilst I am gone
5 I long to ago,-then farewell, woe,
To do my work below ;
And keep your garments white,
Indulge no tears for me;
My soul will be at rest;
When Christ doth call I trust I shall
For you and me, that we may be
I hope to sing and praise my King
No more shall I complain nor sigh,
Be ready then to go.
The children of the light.
To all eternity:
But taste the heavenly feast.
I leave you all, both great and small,
If you die first, anon you must,
Millions of years over the spheres
O may we meet and be complete,
In Christ's encircling arms.
The will of God be done :
Shall pass in sweet repose,
And long together dwell,
Who can you save from the cold grave
I hope the Lord will you reward
While beauty bright unto my sight
And serve the Lord with one accord,
And shield you from all harms.
With an immortal crown.
Thy sacred sweets disclose.
And so, dear friends, farewell !
