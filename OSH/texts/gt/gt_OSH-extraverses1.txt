1. { My Christian friends, in bonds of love, Whose hearts in sweetest union join, } 2. Your company's sweet, your union dear,                        Yet
     Your friendship's like a drawing band, Yet we must take the parting hand.                                       Your words delightful to my ear









3. { How sweet the hours have passed away Since we have met to sing and pray; } 4. O could I stay with friends so kind,                            But
     How loath we are to leave the place Where Jesus shows his smil-ing face.                                   How would it cheer my drooping mind!





                                                                        5 And since it is God's holy will,               9 And now, my friends, both old and young,
                                                                          We must be parted for a while,                   I hope in Christ you'll still go on ;
                                                                          In sweet submission, all as one,                 And if on earth we meet no more,
                                                                          We'll say, our Father's will be done.            O may we meet on Canaan's shore.
when I see that we must part You draw like chords around my heart.
                                                                        6 My youthful friends, in Christian ties,       10 I hope you'll all remember me
                                                                          Who seek for mansions in the skies,              If on earth no more I see ;
                                                                          Fight on, we'll gain that happy shore,           An interest in your prayers I crave,
                                                                          Where parting will be known no more.             That we meet beyond the grave.

                                                                        7 How oft I've seen your flowing tears,         11 O glorious day ! O blessed hope !
                                                                          And heard you tell your hopes and fears !        My soul leaps forward at the thought
                                                                          Your hearts with love were seen to flame,        When, on that happy, happy land,
                                                                          Which makes me hope we'll meet again.            We'll no more take the parting hand.
duty makes me understand That we must take the parting hand.
                                                                        8 Ye mourning souls, lift up your eyes.         12 But with our blessed holy Lord
                                                                          To glorious mansions in the skies ;              We'll shout and sing with one accord,
                                                                          O trust His grace—in Canaan's land.              And there we'll all with Jesus dwell,
                                                                          We'll no more take the parting hand.             So, loving Christians, fare you well.


    Jeremiah Ingalls was a native of the State of Massachusetts ; born in 1764 and died in 1828.  In 1804 he published a book called " Christian Harmony." The
above tune, " Parting Hand," was composed in 1803.  He was a music teacher, and traveled through the States of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts.
Among some of the leading tunes of his are " Northfield " and " New Jerusalem."  A more extended sketch of Mr. Ingalls is given under the tune of " North-
field."  It may be that he wrote the words to " Parting Hand," as well as the music.  He usually wrote the words to his own tunes.
