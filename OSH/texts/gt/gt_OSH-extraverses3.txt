2. {                                                                                                          }  Shout, O      glo  -  ry! for I  shall
     And with my blessed Jesus, Drink endless pleasures in, And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning?

    John Leland was born in Massachusetts in 1754 and died in 1844.  He was a Baptist minister, laboring mostly in Virginia and Massachusetts.  His life
and writings were published in 1845 by Miss L. F. Green.  His two noted hymns were, " O When Shall I See Jesus?" and " The Day is Past and Gone."
For further sketch see " Bound for Canaan."  This is claimed by William Walker under another name.  We find it credited to Major White for so long a
time that we are unwilling to make the change as to authorship.  See revisions of " Sacred Harp " up to 1869.
