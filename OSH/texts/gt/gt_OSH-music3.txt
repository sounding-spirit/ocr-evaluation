MY HOME. C. M. 51

"Thine eyes shall behold all the land."--ISA. 33: 17.

SAMUEL STENNETT. Key of E Minor. C. F. LETSON

1. On Jor-dan's storm-y banks I stand, And cast a wish-ful eye to Ca-naan's fair and happy land, Where my pos-ses-sions lie.

2. O the trans-port-ing, rap-t'rous scene, That rises to  my sight! Sweet fields ar-rayed in liv-ing green, And riv-ers of de-light.

CHORUS

Don't you feel like go-ing home, Don't you feel like go-ing home; My home it is in the promised land, And I feel like go-ing home.

Yes, I feel like go-ing home, Yes, I feel like go-ing home; My home it is in the prom-ised land, And I feel like go-ing home.

Samuel Stennett was one of the most influential and highly respected ministers of the Dissenting persuasion in England, and was a confidant of many of the
distinguished statesmen of his time. Doctor of Divinity was bestowed upon him by the Aberdeen University. He composed and published thirty-eight hymns.
Beside this, he wrote and published theological works. He died in London in 1795.
Nothing is know of C. F. Letson, the person to whom credit is given as being the author of this tune. No trace can be obtained when he composed it.
