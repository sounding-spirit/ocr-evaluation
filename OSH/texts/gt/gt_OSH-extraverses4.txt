1. { When   Adam was cre-at  -  ed, He dwelt in Eden's shade;          }  2. Ten thousand times ten thousand, Of creatures swarmed around,  Be-
     As      Moses has re-lat  -  ed, Be-fore a bride was     made.











3. { He    had no conso - la - tion, But seemed as one alone,             }  4. This woman was not taken From Adam's head, we know;   And
     Till,     to his ad-mi - ra - tion, He found he'd lost a     bone.







                                                                           5 This woman she was taken                  And she must be protected
                                                                               From near to Adam's heart,                From injury and harm.
                                                                             By which we are directed
                                                                               That they should never part.         10 This woman was not taken
fore  a  bride was  form - ed,  Or   a - ny mate was found.                                                              From Adam's feet, we see;
                                                                           6 The book that's called the Bible,         And she must not be abused,
                                                                               Be sure you don't neglect;                The meaning seems to be.
                                                                             For in every sense of duty,
                                                                                It will you both direct.            11 The husband is commanded
                                                                                                                         To love his loving bride ;
                                                                           7 The woman is commanded                    And live as does a Christian,
                                                                               To do her husband's will,                 And for his house provide.
                                                                             In every thing that's lawful,
                                                                               Her duty to fulfill.                 12 The woman is commanded
                                                                                                                         Her husband to obey,
                                                                           8 Great was his exultation,                 In every thing that's lawful,
                                                                               To see her by his side;                   Until her dying day.
she must not rule  o'er  him, It's  ev - i - dent-ly    so.                  Great was his elevation,
                                                                               To have a loving bride.              13 Avoiding all offences,
                                                                                                                         Not sow the seed of strife,
                                                                           9 This woman she was taken                  These are the solemn duties
                                                                               From under Adam's arm;                    Of every man and wife.



    See other sketches of Edmund Dumas, the author of the above tune.  This tune was written and named Edmonds for Eld. Edmonds  who helped to revise the
"Sacred Harp" in 1859.  It was put in the place of the tune "Creation," removed in 1859.  We cannot find when the words were first published.  Mr. Edmonds
taught music with E. T. Pounds.  He lived in Monroe county, Georgia, and died in that county when he was over sixty years old, 1884.
