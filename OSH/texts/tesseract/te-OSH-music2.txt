4. Grace all the work shall crown Through ev-er-last-ing days; It lays in heav’nthe top - most stone, And well de - serves our praise.

This hymn is on “‘ Salvation by Grace,’’ from the author’s hymns, 1755. The original name of this tune was “ Kentucky.’’ Philip Doddridge, D. D., the
author of the hymn, was born in London, 1702, over two hundred years ago. He was a scholar of high attainments; was ordained to the Nonconformist
ministry; was an English Congregationalist, and for many years pastor of one of these churches, from 1829 to the time of his death, 1852. He was a great pulpit
orator and theologian. He composed many standard hymns and high-class sacred music.

See sketch of Jeremiah Ingalls under the tune ‘‘ Northfield.” He is the author of some of the best music of those who composed in his day, and many of his
tunes are still popular with the church people, especially in the United States, and many of his best productions are in the leading tune and hymn books of to-day.

This tune appears in Jeremiah Ingall’s ‘‘ Song Books,” beginning 1805 to 1820; also in the ‘‘ Southern Harmony,” by Walker, 1835 and 1849, by same author;

in the “‘ Christian Harmony,” 1866 and 1901. See ‘‘ Missouri Harmony,’’ page 31, 1837, and many other publications. Copyright, 1909, by J: S, James,
WEBSTER. S. M.
Isaac Watts, 1707. Key of G Major. ‘“‘If a man love me, he will keep my words.”

This tune appears in ‘‘ Southern Harmony,” 1835, by William Walker, and many other sacred tune books prior to that time. The original name was
“Heavenly Joys on Earth,’”’ appearing in Watts’ ‘‘ Hymns of Spiritual Songs.”

The author of the tune “ Webster ”’ is unknown, it having appeared in a large number of song books for the last sixty years without being credited to any one.
There are certain claims, however, that it may have been written by Corelli. We think this is a mistake. The tune may have been taken from a melody by
Handel, but there is no certainty about it.
