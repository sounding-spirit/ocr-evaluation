See other sketches of Edmund Dumas, the author of the above tune.
“Sacred Harp’’ in 1859. . It was put in the place of the tune ‘Creation,’

taught music with E. T. Pounds.

> removed in 1859.

5 This woman she was taken

From near to Adam’s heart,

By which we are directed

That they should never part.

6 The book thai’s called the Bible,

Be sure you don’t neglect;

For in every sense of duty,

It will you both direct.

7 The woman is commanded

To do her husband’s will,

In every thing that’s lawful,

Her duty to fulfill.

8 Great was his exultation,

To see her by his side;

Great was his elevation,

To have a loving bride.

g This woman she was taken

From under Adam’s arm;

And she must be protected
From injury and harm.

10 This woman was not taken
From Adam’s feet, we see;
And she must not be abused,
The meaning seems to be.

11 The husband is commanded
To love his loving bride;
And live as does a Christian,
And for his house provide.

12 The woman is commanded
Her husband to obey,
In every thing that’s lawful,
Until her dying day.

13 Avoiding all offences,
Not sow the seed of strife,
These are the sclemn duties
Of every man and wife.

This tune was written and named Edmonds for Eld. Edmonds who helped to revise the
We cannot find when the words were first published. Mr. Edmonds

He lived in Monroe county, Georgia, and died in that county when he was over sixty years oid, 1884.
