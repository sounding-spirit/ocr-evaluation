2 Yet do I find my heart inclined 3 [trust you’ll pray, both nightand day, 4 If I’m called home whilst I am gone 5 I long to ago,—then farewell, woe,
| . To do my work below; And keep your garments white, indulge no tears for me; My soul will be at rest;
i When Christ doth call I trust I shall For you and me, that we may be I hope to sing and praise my King No more shall I complain nor sigh,
Be ready then to go. The children of the light. To all eternity: But taste the heavenly feast.
; I leave you all, both great and small, If you die first, anon you must, Millions of years over the spheres O may we meet and be complete,
a In Christ’s encircling arms. The will of God be done: Shall pass in sweet repose, And long together dwell,
Ue Who can you save from the cold grave I hope the Lord will you reward While beauty bright unto my sight And serve the Lord with one accord,
And shield you from all harms. With an immortal crown. Thy sacred sweets disclose. And so, dear friends, farewell !
