Jeremiah Ingalls was a native of the State of Massachusetts; born in 1764 and died in 1828. In 1804 he published a book called “ Christian Harmony.” The                                                                                                 
above tune, “ Parting Hand,” was composed in 1803. He was a music teacher, and traveled through the States of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts.                                                                                                 
Among some of the leading tunes of his are “ Northfield” and “ New Jerusalem.” A more extended sketch of Mr. Ingalls is given under the tune of “ North-
