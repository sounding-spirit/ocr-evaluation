The leading note is always on some one line or space of the music staff                        to produce a pleasing effect upon the ear. (See ex-

The different parts of music are called: 1. Bass, the lowest part; 2. Tenor,         is time to music.” There is placed on the music staff signs showing what kind   
the leading part; 3. Alto, next to lowest part; 4. Treble, written on tenor staff.   of time the music is set to, cabled Modes of Time. There are numbers of         
Note---The Alto, sometimes called Counter, is sung by female voices of               them, namely: Common, triple, compound and others. Mode of time is a            
low register. Bass is sung by male voices of low register. Tenor, the leading        particular system of constituting sound, by which the octave is divided into    
part (Cantus, song), is sung by male voices of high register. This part, by          certain intervals according to arrangement of the tune or notes on the scale    
some writers, is called Soprano, and is sung by female voices of high register.      in major or minor key.                                                          
Harmony is the art of binding tones into cords and treating those cords                                                                                              
according to certain rules.                                                          There are figures placed at the beginning of a tune when understood will        
Note---Harmony is the foundation of Melody and we must have a knowl-                 show into how many parts the measure is divided. The music is divided into      
edge of one to appreciate the other. One is not complete without the other;          measures by placing a small bar across the lines of the staff, each of these    
if we hear a succession of harmonies we cannot fail to detect in it a perfect        sub-divisions by these small bars is a measure. In each of these measures       
flow of melody.                                                                      there is what is called Measure Bars.
