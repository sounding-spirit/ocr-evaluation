THE HEAVENLY UNION.

1_Con, saints
tell,

The wonders of Emmanuel.

Who saved me from a burning hell

And brought my soul With Him to
dwell,

And gave me Heavenly Union.

2—When Jesus saw me from on high
Beheld my soul in ruin lie.
It grieved me so that I must die.
I strove salvation for to buy,
Rut still I found no Union.

and sinners, hear me |

3—But when I hated all my sins,

| My dear Redeemer took me in,

| And with His blood, He washed me
| clean,

| And, oh, what seasons I have seen
Since first I found this Union.

4—I praised the Lord both night and
day,

[ went from_house to: house to pray,

And if I met one on the way,

| Lalways found something to say
| About the Heavenly Union.

5—I wonder why all saints don’t sing

And make the heavenly arches ring,

And spread the news from pole to pole

"Till every nation has been told
About the Heavenly Union.
