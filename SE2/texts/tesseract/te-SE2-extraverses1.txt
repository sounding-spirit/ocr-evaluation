Don’t for- get that. God  a-bove you,-Hath a gra - cious heart,
When the world in arms as-sail you, And your cour- age fail,
When the stormsof life are beat- ing, Hard up-on_ your head,
Tell him there’s a pre - cious fountain, Flow - ing free for all,

§ Tell him that above a brother,

There’s a Saviour’s love,

If on earth he has no other,
There’s a friend above.

If he needs your help and kindness,
Don’t withhold your hand,

Always of this be reminded,
He’s your fellow man.

6 Then when Jesus comes in Glory,
On the judgement throne,
In His book will be the story,
All shall be made known.
There above all other favors,
On the golden strand,
Will be placed upon your labera,
For your fellow man.
