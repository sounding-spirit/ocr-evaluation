I shall see theland of Beu-lah, With my eyesundimmed by _ tears.
In thy cleft O Rock of A- ges, Where no harm can — be - tide.

4 Should the world in arms confront me, {5 By and by when war is over.
Though the host of hell combine, And the saints are gathering home,
In His name I’!1 win the vict’ry, In the presence of Jehovah,
With His word the conqueror’s sign. Where the pilgrim ne’er shall roams
Onur Lord forever reigns, My Jesus will be there,
And to His dazzling train, His glory I shall share,
He has bound the fate of nations, | He will introduce my spirit,
And His kingdom He’ll maintain. ~ To His Father as an heir,
