Neo, <1. Christian Seaman,

 

      
    

i Sime is a soormy ocean, ) 5 To thoSe who are spectators,
Beyond which Heaven lies, What sorrows inust ensue
We must brave its wild commotion, | To have their old companions
To enter Paradise. To bid them a long adieu,
2 But vessels built by human skill, | 6 But pleasures of a Paradise
Have never sailed afar. No longer them invite
Till they are found run aground ** We'll sail while they rail,

   
 

On some dreadful sandy bar. For we’ll soon be out of sight,”

  
      

3 The éveriastitig Gospel 7 ‘We are a band of sailors,
Has :aunched the deep at last In harmony and love,
> . ’ y 3 $
Behold her sails suspended The wind is in our favor,

   
 

Around the towering masts. How joyfully we move.’’

    
     
    
  

4 And on her decks in order 8 ‘About our future happiness,
The joyful sailors stand, There need be no debate,
Crying, ‘‘Oh here we go While we ride on the tide

    

To Immanuel’s happy land.’’ With our Captain and His Mate.”
