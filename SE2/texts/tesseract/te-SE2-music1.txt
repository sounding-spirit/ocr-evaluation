If . your life in days gone by, Has not been good and true,
. Perhapsyour tem-per is tc blame,For ma- ny wrongs you do,
If in your home the troub-le is The course you should pursue,
. And if some sin your soul hath bound With cords you can’t un- do,
- May be to you the world is dark, And comforts far and few,

In your own way no lon- ger try, But let Him fix it for you.
Take it toGod in Je-sus’name,And He will fix it for yon.
Go talk with God,your hand in His, And He will fix it for you.

At Je-sus’ feet go lay it down And He will fix it for you.

Let Je-sus own and rule your heart And He will fix it for you.
