GOD BE WITH YOU
TILL WE MEET

1—God be with you till we meet again;
By His counsels guide, uphold  you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
God be with you till we meet again

CHORUS.

    ll we meet, till we meet,
  Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
  Till we meet, till we meet,
  God be with you till we meet again

 —God be with you till we meet again,
 Neath His wings securely hide  you
Daily manna still provide you;
God be with you till we meet  again.

3—God be with you till we meet again,
When life's perils thick confound you,
Put His arms unfailing round you;
God be with you till we meet  again.

4—God be with you till we meet again;
Keep love's banner floating o'er you;
Smith death's threatening  wave  be-
   fore you;
God be with you till we meet again.

HE SAVED ME

1—I was once far away from the
   Saviour,
  And His face was not smiling on me;
  wonder if Christ the Redeemer,
  Would save a poor sinner like me.
 —I was long in that sad night of
   darkness,
  Not a bright ray of light could I see;
This thought filled my poor heart
   with sadness,
  No hope for a poor sinner like me.

 —But there in that dark lonely hour,
  Came a  voice sweetly  whispering
   to me,
Saying, Christ the  Redeemerhath,
   power
  To save a poor sinner like me.

 —I listened,  and lo! 'twas the
   Saviour,
  Then speaking so kindly to me;
And now unto others I am telling,
  How he saved a poor sinner like me.

 —I then fully trusted in Jesus
  And oh, what a joy cam  t  me;
My heart it was filled wit   His
   praises,
  For saving a sin er like me.

HOME OF THE SOUL
1—I will sing you a song of that
    beautiful land,
  That far away home of the soul,
Where no storms ever  beat on the
   glittering strand
  While the years of eternity roll.
CHORUS
I have anchor  my soul in  the
    haven of rest
I will safl the wide seas no more,
  The tempest may sweep  o'er the
    wild stormy deep,
In Jesus  I am safe for ever more,

2—O, that home of the soul in my
    visions and dreams,
  Its bright Jasper walls I can see,
Till I fancy but thinly the veil inter-
    venes
Beneath the fair city and me.

3—That unchangeable home is for
    you and for me,
  Where Jesus of Nazareth stands;
The king of all kingdoms forever is
    He,
And He holdeth our crowns in His
    hands.

4—O how sweet it will be in that
    beautiful land,
  So free from all sorrow and  pain:
With songs on our lips and with
    harps in our hands,
  To meet one another again.

ALMOST PERSUADED

1—"Almost persuaded now  to be-
   lieve;
  "Almost persuaded" Christ to re-
   ceive.
Seems now some soul to say,
  Go, Spirit, go thy way,
Some more convenient day
     On Thee I'll call.

2—"Almost persuaded," come, come
   today;
  "Almost persuaded,"  turn  not
   away;
Jesus invites you here,
  Angels are lingering near,
Prayers rise from hearts so dear;
     "O, wanderer come."

3—"Almost persuaded," harvest is
   past!
  "Almost persuaded," doom comes
   at last!
"Almost" can not avail;
  "Almost" is but to fail
Sad, sad that bitter wail—
     "Almost—but lost!"
