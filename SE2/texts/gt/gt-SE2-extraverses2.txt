I tried it for awhile,
Keeping up with every style,
  And was trying to ge’ the crown with-
	out the cross.
I found it would not do;
For the word of God is true, [lost,
  And unless I live uprigh I would be

Then I put the world aside,
Taking Jesus for my guide,
  I began to try to walk the narrow

It is tedious, I admit,
But I am not weary yet;
  I shall travel on until the perfect day.

No. 11. Christian Seaman.

1 Time is a s ormy ocean,
	Beyond which Heaven lies,
  We must brace its wild commotion,
	To enter Paradise.

2 But vessels built by human skill,
	Have never sailed afar,
  Till they are found run aground
	On some dreadful sandy bar.

3 The everlasting Gospel
	Has launched the deep at last,
  Behold her sails suspended
	Around the towering masts.

4 And on her decks in order
	The joyful sailors stand,
  Crying, “Oh here we go
	To Immanuel’s happy land.”

5 To those who are spectators,
	What sorrows must ensue
  To have their old companions
	To big them a long adieu.

6 But pleasures of a Paradise
	No longer them invite
  “We’ll sail while they rail,
	For we’ll soon be out of sight.”

7 “We are a band of sailors,
   In harmony and love,
  The wind is in our favor,
   How joyfully we move.”

8 “About our future happiness,
	There need be no debate,
   While we ride on the tide
	With our Captain and His Mate.”
