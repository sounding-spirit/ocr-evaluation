No. 5.	Let Jesus Fix it for You.
  C. A. TINDLEY.	F. A. CLARK






1.   If     your life   in days gone by,  Has  not been good and  true,















In your own way no  lon- ger try, But  let Him fix   it  for   you.








CHORUS.





Let   Je - sus fix   it  for  you,  He knows just what  to  do; When -














ev-er you pray,let Him have His way,And He will fix  it for   you.














2.  Perhaps your tem - per  is    to blame,For  ma- ny wrongs you do,
Take it   to God  in  Je-sus' name,And He will fix   it  for   you.














3.   If   in your home the troub- le   is   The course you should pursue,
Go talk with God,your hand in His, And He will fix   it  for   you.














4.  And  if some sin your soul hath bound With cords you can't un- do,
At  Je - sus' feet go   lay  it down And He will fix   it  for   you.














5.  May be  to  you   the world is  dark, And comforts  far   and few,
Let Je-sus own and rule your heart And He will fix   it  for   you.
