PREFACE

	A long felt desire for songs with words of Hope, Cheer,
Love and Pity; for melodies that can sink to the depth of
sorrow and rise to the heights of joy, has had most to do
with the publication of this book.
	It is the prayer of the publishers that these messages
in rhyme shall float from soul to soul until the hills and
valleys shall awake into joyful singing.
