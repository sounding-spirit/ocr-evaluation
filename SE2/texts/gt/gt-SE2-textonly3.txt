THE LILY OF THE VALLEY
(Key of F. Flat)
1—I've found  a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me;
    He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
The Lily of the Vally, in Him alone I see
    All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole;
In  sorrow He's my comfort, trouble He's my stay;
    He's the Lily of the Valley the  bright and morning
     Star,
    He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
CHORUS
In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay,
    He tells me every care on Him to roll;
He's the Lily  of the Valley, the bright and morn-
  ing Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
2—He all my grief has taken and all my sorrows
     borne;
In temtation He's my strong and mighty tower;
    I've all for Him forsaken, I've all my idols torn
From my heart and now He keeps me by His
      power.
    Tho' all the world forsakes me, and Satan tempts me sore,
Thro' Jesus I shall safely reach the goal;
     He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and morn-
       ing Star.
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.—
3—He'll never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me
       here,
      While I live by faith and do His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear,
      With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.
When crowned at last in glory I'll see His blessed
       face,
     Where rivers of delight shall ever roll;
He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and morning
      Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.—

1—Amazing grace; how how sweet the
   sound;
  That saved a wretch like me;
I once was lost, but now  I am  found,
  Was blind, but now I see.

2—'Twas grace that taught my  heart
   to fear,
  And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace  appear,
  The hour I first believed.

3—Through many dangers, toils and
   snares,
  I have already come;
Tis grace hath brought me safe  thus
   far,
  And grace will lead me home.

4—Yea,  when this flesh  and heart
   shall fail,
  And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the vail,
  A life of joy and peace.

5—The earth shall soon pissolve like
   snow
  The sun forbear to shine;
But God who called me here below,
  Will be forever mine.
