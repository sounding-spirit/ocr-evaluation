Go  Wash  in  the  Beautiful  Stream.

C. A TINDLEY	C. A. TINDLEY.



1. There was Naaman the leper,that honorable man, A     captain of the  Sy-rian





host,   He was bad-ly  af-flict-ed and sick in the land, And  a  bur-den  to






all of his  host:  Oh, my! what a sight, his disease made him white, No doctor could






help him I've seen,  He  nev-er did pray and he knew not the way, To get in - to the







beau-ti - ful stream. Go wash in the beauti-ful stream,Go wash in the beauti- ful







stream,O, Naaman, O,Naaman,go down and wash Go wash in the beautiful stream.







2.    He  heard of a man in the  He  -  brew land,  A    lit-tle maid told him a
bout,    I'll   go  if  I   can    he  said to his friend,  For    he may  re -
lieve me no  doubt:So  he went and called on the servant of God,And E-li-sha re -
fused  to  be  seen, But he lifted his burden and sent him to Jordan,To wash in the
beau-ti - ful stream.







3.    So Naaman went on and the servant had gone, Whom E-li-sha had sent to  the
door,    He   did not be - lieve that he had received, From the Prophet a
per  - fect cure,  He tho't that the rivers down in his own land,Were better be-
cause they were clean, It was just about night when he got in the light And plunged into the
beau-ti - ful stream.







4.    O,    sin-ner, O, sin-ner,are you not the same ? As   Naaman that noted Sy-
rian ?   Your sickness in - jures both bod-y  and soul,  And makes you feel
loathsome and mean,If you feel you are lost, just shoulder the cross,  And Je - sus will
then make you clean,If you feel you are sick, just come along quick,And get into the
beau-ti - ful stream.
