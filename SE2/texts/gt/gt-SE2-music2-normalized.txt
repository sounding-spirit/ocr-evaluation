Words and Music by C. A. TINDLEY.	Arr. by F. A. CLARK.






1.  Noth-ing  be-tween  my  soul and the Sav- iour,Naught of this world'sde -














lus  -  ive dream.   I  have renounced all   sin  -  ful pleas-ure,








                                                    CHORUS.





Je - sus   is  mine;there's noth-ing  be-tween. }    Noth-ing  be-tween  my














soul and the Sav-iour  So  that His bless- ed face may be seen; Nothing pre-














vent-ing the least of  His fa- vor,  Keep the way clear!let nothing between.














2.  Noth-ing  be-tween like  world -  ly pleas-ure,  Hab - its   of  life   tho'
harmless they seem,  Must not my heart from Him ev - er  sev - er,
He   is  my  all,  there's noth-ing  be-tween.














3.  Noth-ing  be-tween,like   pride    or   sta-tion,   Self    or friends shall
not  in - ter- vene,  Tho' it  may cost   me much trib - u  -  la - tion,
I   am  re-solved,there's noth-ing  be-tween.














4.  Noth-ing  be-tween, e'en ma - ny hard  tri - als, Tho' the whole world  a -
gainstme con- vene; Watching with pray'r and much self-de - ni - al,   I'll
tri-umph at  last,   with  noth-ing  be-tween.
