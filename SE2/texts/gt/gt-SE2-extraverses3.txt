No. 24. The Lord Will Make the Way.

C. A. T. 	C. A. TINDLEY

1. The hills of life which you must climb, Each mo-ment, day by day,
2. Although your progress may be poor, But if you watch and pray,
3. To do your du - ty here be - low, And be just what you say,
4. But when you find you can’t do more, You plans must all de - lay,

 Are rough; the path is hard to find, But God will make the way.
What - ev - er else, of this I’m sure, The Lord will make the way.
May not be eas - y, but you know The Lord will make the way.
The prom - ise comes just as be - fore, The Lord will make the way.

CHORUS.

The Lord will make the way, .... The Lord will make the way;....
					the way,					   the way,

If you can on - ly trust and wait, The Lord will make the way.

5 When comforts of this world are few,
	And friends are far away,
  Remember always this is true,
	The Lord will make the way.

6 When hard and heavy is your load,
	And not a single ray
  Of light is shining on the road,
	Just wait, there’ll be a way.

7 Sometimes the tempter tries his plans,
	To make you go astray,
  But keep your hand in Jesus’ hand,
	And he will lead the way.

8 And when the dreary road you tread,
	Which leads to endless day,
  O praise the Lord, there’ll be no dread,
	For Christ will be the way.
