THE HEAVENLY UNION.
1_Com, saints and sinners, hear me
   tell,
The wonders of Emmanuel,
Who saved me from a burning hell
And brought my soul with Him to
   dwell,
And gave me Heavenly Union.

2—When Jesus saw me from on high
Beheld my soul in ruin lie,
It grieved me so that I must die.
I strove salvation for to buy,
   But still I found no Union.

3—But when I hated all my sins,
My dear Redeemer took me in,
And with His  blood  He washed me
   clean,
And, oh, what seasons I have seen
Since first I found this Union.

4—I praised the Lord both night and
   day,
I went from house to house to pray,
And if I met one on the way,
I always found something to say
About the Heavenly Union.

5—I wonder why all saints don't sing
And make the heavenly  arches ring,
And spread the news from pole to pole
'Till every nation has been told
  About the Heavenly Union.

NO. 22.
AWAY IN THE KINGDOM.
1—Come all oppressed and hear me
   tell
  Away in the Kingdom,
That Jesus conquered death and hell,
  Away in the Kingdom.
He bought my pardon on the Tree,
  Away in the Kingdom.
I'm glad to tell you now I'm free,
  Away in the Kingdom.

CHORUS.

There's plenty of room.  There's
   plenty of room,
  Away in the Kingdom.
There's plenty of room, my Jesus
   says,
  Away in the Kingdom.

2—Of glorious liberty I'll sing,
  Away in the Kingdom.
And make the heavenly arches ring,
  Away in the Kingdom.
He, all my prison bars did break,
  Away in the Kingdom.
My yoke of bondage He did take,
  Away in the Kingdom.—Chorus.

3—I all my sins on Him did lay,
  Away in the Kingdom,
And this to me my Lord did say,
  Away in the Kingdom.
"If you my mandates will obey,
  Away in the KingdOm.
I'll give you a home with me to stay."
  Away in the Kingdom.—Chorus.

4—Lord, I believe a rest remains,
  Away in the Kingdom.
A rest where pure enjoyment reigns,
  Away in the Kingdom.
A rest where all our soul's desire,
  Away in the Kingdom,
Where fear and sin and grief expire,
  Away in the Kingdom.—Chorus.
