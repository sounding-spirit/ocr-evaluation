No. 1 Pilgrim Stranger

Words by C. A. TINDLEY, D. D. Scotch Melody arr. by WM. D. SMITH.

1. Go ye hum-ble pil - grim stran-ger, Thro’ this world of woe,
2. If your way is dark and lone- ly, He will be your guide,
3. When dis-cour-aged and for - sak - en, Run to Him in pray’r,
4. If you chance to find a stran- ger, Put him in the way, 

You may meet with many a dan - ger, Ev - ’ry- where you go
He is, though so meek and low - ly, More than all be - side.
Nev - er has been one o’er- tak - en, Who re - sort - ed there.
Tell him how to flee the dan - ger, While it is called day.

Don’t for- get that God a- bove you, Hath a gra - cious heart,
When the world in arms as- sail you, And your cour- age fail,
When the storms of life are beat- ing, Hard up - on your head,
Tell him there’s a pre - cious fountain, Flow - ing free for all,

He will nev - er cease to love you, Or to take your part.
Let Him fight your bat - tle for you, And you will pre - vail.
God will hide you, He is plead - ing, “Be ye not a - fraid.”
Je - sus Christ, on Cal-vary’s mountain, Paid for A - dam’s fall.

5 Tell him that above a brother,
	There’s a Saviour’s love,
   If on earth he has no other,
	There’s a friend above.
   If he needs your help and kindness,
	Don’t withhold your hand,
   Always of this be reminded,
	He’s your fellow man.

6 Then when Jesus comes in Glory,
	On the judgement throne,
  In His book will be the story,
	All shall be made known.
  There above all other favors,
	On the golden strand,
  Will be placed upon your labors,
	For your fellow man.
