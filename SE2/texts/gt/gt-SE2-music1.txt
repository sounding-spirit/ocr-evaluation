No. 5.	Let Jesus Fix it for You.
  C. A. TINDLEY.	F. A. CLARK






1.   If     your life   in days gone by,  Has  not been good and  true,
2.  Perhaps your tem - per  is    to blame,For  ma- ny wrongs you do,
3.   If   in your home the troub- le   is   The course you should pursue,
4.  And  if some sin your soul hath bound With cords you can't un- do,
5.  May be  to  you   the world is  dark, And comforts  far   and few,














In your own way no  lon- ger try, But  let Him fix   it  for   you.
Take it   to God  in  Je-sus' name,And He will fix   it  for   you.
Go talk with God,your hand in His, And He will fix   it  for   you.
At  Je - sus' feet go   lay  it down And He will fix   it  for   you.
Let Je-sus own and rule your heart And He will fix   it  for   you.








CHORUS.





Let   Je - sus fix   it  for  you,  He knows just what  to  do; When -














ev-er you pray,let Him have His way,And He will fix  it for   you.
