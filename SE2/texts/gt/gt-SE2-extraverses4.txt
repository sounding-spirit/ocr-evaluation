No. 41. I Have Found at Last a Saviour.

Words and Melody by C. A. Tindley. Arranged by F. A. Clark.

1. I have found at last the Sav - iour, Of whom I’ve oft - en heard,
2. I have promised I would fol - low, How ev - er rough the way,
3. Christ is now my sum of pleas-ure, Counting all things else but dross,

And I have the pre-cious fa - vor, He has promised in His word:
Leav-ing all things of to - mor-row, I will trust Him just to - day:
I have found my richest treas- ure, A - round the sa - cred Cross:

O, the joy that comes to me, . . . . And the pow’r that makes me free, . . . . 
For the moruing doth ap - pear, . . . Which will banish ev - ’ry fear, . . . . .
My soul is sat - is - fied, For - ev - er to a - bide . .  . . 
					to me, 				me free,

My soul is filled with praises, ’Tis the year of ju - bi - lee.
I shall see the land of Beu-lah, With my eyes undimmed by tears.
In thy cleft O Rock of A - ges, Where no harm can e’er be - tide.

4 Should the world in arms confront me,
	Though the bost of hell combine,
  In His name I’ll win the vict’ry,
	With His word the conqueror’s sign.
  Our Lord forever reigns,
	And to His dazzling train,
  He has bound the fate of nations,
	And His kingdom He'll maintain.

5 By and by when war is over.
	And the saints are gathering home,
  In the presence of Jehovah,
	Where the pilgrim ne’er shall roam:
  My Jesus will be there,
	His glory I shall share,
  He will introduce my spirit,
	To His Father as an heir.
