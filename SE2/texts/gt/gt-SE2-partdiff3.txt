12 I Will Go, If My Father Holds My Hand.

Words and Music by C. A. TINDLEY. 	Arranged by F. A. CLARK.

1. When the path- way of du - ty seems with dan - ger fill’d,
2. If my Father holds my hand I can keep the nar-row way,
3. Tho’ my strength is weak, by His grace I will seek
4. When in the vale of sor- row I am call’d to go,
5. When the aw - ful waves of Jor - dan beat up - on my soul,

And the charms of world- ly beau - ty al - most win my fee- ble will,
If my Fa - ther holds my hand, I can nev- er go a- stray,
To re - pose like Ma - ry at the Sav - iour’s feet;
And it seems each to - mor-row simp - ly brings an- oth - er woe,
In the i - cy hands of death my limbs are growing cold,

While I see the Cross up - lift- ed, and can hear the King’s command,
Though oft it is so dark I can hard - ly find the way
Then to climb to the - heights of pure de - light
I am sat - is - fied to fol - low where He leads, this I know,
I have noth- ing then to fear if my Lord, is near, 

I will go, if my Fa- ther holds my hand. . . . . . . . 
I will go, if my Fa- ther holds my hand. . . . . . . . 
I can  go, if my Fa- ther holds my hand. . . . . . . . 
I can  go, if my Fa- ther holds my hand. . . . . . . . 
I will go, if my Fa- ther holds my hand. . . . . . . . 
								holds my hand.
