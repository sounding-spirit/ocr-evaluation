12 y Will Go, Yf My father Holds My Hand.
Words and Music by C. A. TINDLEY.
Arranged by F. A. CLARK.
1. When the path- way of du - ty seems with dan - ger fillid,
2. If my Father holds my hand I can keep the nar-row way,
3. Tho' my strength is
weak, by His grace I will seek
4. When in the vale of sorrow I am call'd to
go,
5. When theaw - ful waves of Jor - dan beat up - on my soul,
And the charms of world- ly beau - ty al - most win my fee- ble will,
If my Fa - ther holds my hand, I can nev-er go a-stray,
To re- pose like Ma- ry at the Say - iour's feet :
And it seems each to - mor-row simp - ly brings an- oth - er woe,
In the
i
y hands of death my limbs are growing cold,
While I see the Cross up - lift- ed, and can hear the King's command,
Though oft it is so dark I can hard - ly find the way,
Then to climb to the heights of the pure de - light,
I am sat - is - fied to fol - low where He leads, this I know,
I have noth-ing then to fear if my Lord is near,
C
if

will
go,
if
my Fa- ther holds my hand.
my Fa- ther holds my
band.
my Fa-ther holds my hand.......
my Fa-ther holds my hand .....
my Fa- ther holds my hand......
holds my hand
