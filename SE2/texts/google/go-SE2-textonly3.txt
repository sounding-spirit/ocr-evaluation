THE LILY OF THE VALLEY
(Key of F. Flat)
1-I've found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me;
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
The Lily of the Vally, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole;
In sorrow He's my comfort, trouble He's my stay;
He tells me every care on Him to roll;
He's the Lily of Valley the bright and morning
Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
CHORUS
In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay,
He tells me every care on Him to roll;
He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and morn-
ing Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
2-He all my grief has taken and all my sorrows
borne;
In temtation He's my strong and mighty tower;
I've all for Him forsaken, I've all my idols torn
From my heart and now He keeps me by His
power.
Tho' all the world forsakes me, and Satan tempts me
sore,
Thro' Jesus I shall safely reach the goal;
He's the Lily of Valley, the bright and morn-
ing Star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.-
3-He'll never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me
here,
While I live by faith and do His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear,
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.
When crowned at last in glory I'll see His blessed
face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll;
He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and morning
Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul. ---

1-Amazing grace; how how sweet the 13-Through many dangers, toils and
sound;
snares,
I have already come;
That saved a wretch like me;
1.Tis grace hath brought me safe thus
I once was lost, but now I am found,
far,
Was blind, put now I see.
And grace will lead me home.
2_'Twas grace that taught my heart 4_Yea
neart 4-Yea, when this flesh and heart
to fear,
shall fail,
And grace my fears relieved;
And mortal life shall cease,
How precious did that grace appear, I shall possess within the vail,
The hour I first believed.
A life of joy and peace.
5â€“The earth shall soon pissolve like
snow
The sun forbear to shine;
But God who called me here below,
Will be forever mine.
