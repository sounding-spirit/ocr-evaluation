In the pres-ence of the Lord all the time.
I tried it for awhile,
Then I put the world aside.
Keeping up with every style,
Taking Jesus for my guide,
And was trying to ge' the crown with. I began to try to walk the narrow

I found it would not do;
It is tedious, I admit,
For the word of God is true, flost, But I am not weary yet;
And unless I live uprigh I would be! I shall travel on until the perfect day.

1 Time is a Soormy oceau,
15 To those who are spectators,
Beyond which Heaven lies,
What gorrows haust ensue
We must brave its wild commotion, To have their old companions
To enter Paradise.
To bid them a long adieu.
2 But vessels built by human skill,
Have never sailed afar.
Till they are found run aground
On some dreadful sandy bar.
6 But pleasures of a Paradise
No longer them invite
“We'll sail while they rail,
For we'll soon be out of sight.
3 The everiasting Gospel
Has iaunched the deep at last,
Behold her sails suspended
Around the towering masts.
7 "We are a band of sailors,
In harmony and love,
The wind is in our favor,
How joyfully we move."
4 And on her decks in order
The joyful sailors stand,
Crying, "Oh here we go
To Immanuel's happy land."
8 "About our future happiness,
There need be no debate,
While we ride on the tide
With our Captain and His Mate.”
