There's a Saviour's love,
On the judgement throne,
If on earth he has no other,
In His book will be the story,
There's a friend above.
All shall be made known.
If he needs your help and kindness,
There above all other favors,
Don't withhold your hand,
On the golden strand,
AJways of this be reminded,
Will be placed upon your laber,
He's your fellow man.
For your fellow man.
