16.41 Y Have found at Lust a Saviour.
Words and Melody by C. A. TINDLEY.
Arranged by F. A. CLARK.
1. I have found at last the Saviour, Of whom I've oft - en heard,
2. I have promised I would fol - low, How ev - er rough the way,
3. Christ is now my sum of pleas-ure, Counting all things else but dross,
And I have the pre-cious fa - vor,
Leav-ing all things of to - mor-row,
I have found my richest treas- ure,
He has promised in His word :
I will trust Him just to - day :
A - round the sa- cred Cross :
0, the joy that comes to me,.... And the pow'r that makes me free,..
For the morning doth ap- pear,... Which will banish ev -'ry fear,.....
My soul is sat-is - fied, For- ev - er to a - bide..
to me,
me free,
My soul is filled with praises, Tis the year ofju - bi - lee.
I shall see the land of Beu-lah, With my eyes updimmed by tears.
In thy cleft 0 Rock of A-ges, Where no harm can e'er be - tide.
- Should the world in arms confront me, 5 By and by when war is over.
Though the bost of hell combine,
And the saints are gathering home,
In His name I'll win the vict'ry, In the presence of Jehovah,
With His word the conqueror's sign. Where the pilgrim ne'er shall roam:
Our Lord forever reigns,
My Jesus will be there,
And to His dazzling train,
His glory I shall share,
He has bound the fate of nations,
He will introduce my spirit,
And His kingdom He'll maintain. To His Father as an heir.
