I tried it for awhile,                                  Then I put the world aside,                  
Keeping up with every style,                            Taking Jesus for my guide,                   
And was trying to ge' the crown with-                   I began to try to walk the narrow

I found it would not do;                                It is tedious, I admit,                      
For the word of God is true, [lost,                     But I am not weary yet;                      
And unless I live upright I would be                    I shall travel on until the perfect day.

 Beyond which Heaven Les,                                      What enrrows Must ensue               
                                                                                                     
 We must brave its wild commotion,                             To have their old companions          
 To enter Paradise.                                            To bid them a long adieu.             
 2 But vessels built by human skill,                           6 But pleasures of a Paradise         
 Have never sailed afar.                                       No longer them invite                 
 Till they are found run aground                               “ We’ll sail while they rail,         
 On some dreadful sandy bar.                                   For we’ll soou be out of sight.**     
 3 The evenastiiig Gospel                                      7 “ We are a band of sailors,         
 Has launched the deep at last,                                In harmony and love,                  
 Behold her sails suspended                                    The wind is in our favor,             
 Around the towering masts.                                    How joyfully we move.”                
 4 And on her decks in order                                   8 “About our future happiness,        
 The joyful sailors stand,                                     There need be no debate,              
 Crying, “Oh here we go                                        While we ride on the tide             
 To Immanuel’s happy land.”                                    With our Captain and His Mate.**
