The Lily of the Vally, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole;
In sorrow He's my comfort, trouble He's my stay;
He tells me every eare on Him to roll;
He' s the Lily of Valley the bright and morning
Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
 CHORUS
In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay,
He tells me every care on Him to roll;
He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and morn-
ing Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
2--He all my grief has taken and allmy sorrows
borne;
In temtation He's my strong and mighty tower;
Ive all for HBim forsaken, I've all my idols torn
From my heart and now He keeps me by His
power.,
Tho' all the world forsakes me, and Satan tempts me
sore,
Thro' Jesus I shall safely reach the goal;
He's thglr of Valley, the brighf and morn-
ing Star.
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.-
3-He'll never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me
here,
While I live by faith and do His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear,
With Eis manna He my hungry soul shall fll.
When crowned at last in glory I'll see His blessed
face,
wher rivers of delight shall ever roll;
He's the Lily of the Valley, the bright and morning
Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.--
