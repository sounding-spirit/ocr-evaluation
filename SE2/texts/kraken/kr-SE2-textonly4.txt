HE SAVED ME
1--I was once far away from the
Saviour,
And His face was not smiling on me;
wonder if Christ the Redeemer,
Would save a poor sinner like me.
-- le in that sad night of
darkness,
Not a bright ray of light could I see;
This thought filled my poor heart
with sadness,
No hope for a poor sinner like me.
-But there in that dark lonely hou,
Came a voice swceetly whispering
to me,
To save a poor siner like me.
Beneath the fair eity and me.
3-That unchangeable home is for
you and ior me,
Where Jesus of Nazareth stands;
The king of all kingdoms forever is
He,
And He holdeth our crowns in His
hands.
4--O how sweet it will be in thait
beautiful land,
So free from all sorrow and pain:
With songs on our lips and with
harps in our hands,
To meet one another again.
