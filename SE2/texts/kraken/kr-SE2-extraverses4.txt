I shall see the land of Beu-lah, With my eyes undimmed by tears..
In thy oleft O Rock of A- ges, Where no harm can e'er be - tide.

4 should the world in arms oonfront me, 5 By and hy when wur is over.
Though the bost of hell combine,
And the saints are gathering home,
In His name I'11 win the vict'ry,
In the presence of Jehovah,
With His word the conqueror'ssign.] Where the pilgrim ne'er shall roam:
Our Lord forever reigns,
A,,gEgE.
And to His dazzling train,
[His glory I shall share,

And His kingdom He'll maiutain. To His Father as an heir.
