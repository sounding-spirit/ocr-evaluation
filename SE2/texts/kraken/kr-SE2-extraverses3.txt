1. The hills of life which you must climb, Each mo-ment, dayby day,

3. To do your du - ty here be -low, And be just what you say,
4. But when you find you cau't do more, You plans must all de - lay,

5 When comforts of this world are few, 7 Sometimes the tempter tries his plans
And friends are far away,
Remember always this is true,
The Lord will make the way.
To make you go astry,
But keep your hand in Jesus' hand,
And he will lead the way.
8 When hard and heavy is your load, 8 And when the dreary road yon tread,
And not a siugle ray
Which leads to endless day,
Of light is shining on the road,  O praise the Lord, there'll be no dread,
Just wait; tlere'll be a way.
For Christ will be the way.
