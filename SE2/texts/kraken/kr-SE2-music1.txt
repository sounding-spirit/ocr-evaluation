2. Perliaps yoar tem - per is to blame, For ma- ny wrongs yo do,
3. If in your home the troub-le is The oourse you should pursue,
4. And if some sin your soul hath bound With oords you can't un- do,
5. May be to yo the world is dark, And oomforts far and few,

In your own way no lon- ger try, But let Him fix
Take it to God in Je-sus' name, And Ho will fix
Go talk with God, your hand in His, And He will fix
At Je- sns' feet go lay it down And He will fix
Let Je-sus own and rule your heart And He will fix
