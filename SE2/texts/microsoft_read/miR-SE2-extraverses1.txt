There's a Saviour's love,
6 Then when Jesus comes in Glory,
On the judgement throne,
If on earth he has no other,
There's a friend above.
In His book will be the story,
If he needs your help and kindness,
All shall be made known.
Don't withhold your hand,
There above all other favors,
On the golden strand,
Always of this be reminded,
He's your fellow man.
Will be placed upon your labors
For your fellow man.
