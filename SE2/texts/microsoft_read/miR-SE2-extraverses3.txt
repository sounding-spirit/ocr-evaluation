No. 24. The Lord Will Make the Way.
C. A. T.
C. A. TINDLEY .
1. The hills of life which you must climb, Each mo-ment, day by
2. Although your progress may be poor, But if you watch and pray,
day,
3. ' To do your du - ty here be - low, And be just what you say,
4. But when you find you can't do more, You plans must all de - lay,
Are rough; the path
hard to find, But God will make the way.
What - ev - er else, of this I'm sure, The Lord will make the way.
May not be eas - y, but you know The Lord will make the way.
The prom - ise comes just as
be - fore, The Lord will make the way.
CHORUS.
O
The Lord will make the way, . ...
The Lord will make the way; . ...
the way,
the way ,
bo bo
If
you can on - ly trust and wait, The Lord will make the way.
5 When comforts of this world are few, 7 Sometimes the tempter tries his plans,
And friends are far away,
To make you go astray,
Remember always this is true,
The Lord will make the way.
But keep your hand in Jesus' hand,
And he will lead the way.
6 When hard and heavy is your load, 8 And when the dreary road you tread,
And not a single ray
Of light is shining on the road,
Which leads to endless day,
Just wait; there'll be a way.
O praise the Lord, there'll be no dread,
For Christ will be the way.
