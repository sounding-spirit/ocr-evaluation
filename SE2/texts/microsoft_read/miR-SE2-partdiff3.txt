1. When the path- way of
du - ty seems with
dan - ger
fill'd,
2. If my Father holds my
hand
I
can keep the nar-row way,
3. Tho' my strength is
weak,
by
His
grace
I will seek
4. When
in the vale of
sor- row
am
call'd to
go,
5. When the
aw - ful waves of Jor - dan beat
up - on my soul,
And the charms of world- ly beau - ty
al - most win my fee- ble will,
If my Fa - ther holds my hand,
I
can nev- er
To re - pose
Ma - ry
at
the Sav
go a- stray,
like
iour's feet ;
And it seems
each to - mor-row simp - ly brings an- oth - er woe,
In the i
cy
hands of death my limbs are growing cold,
While I see
the Cross up - lift- ed, and can hear the King's command,
Though off
it
is
so dark
I
can hard -ly find the way,
Then to
climb
to
the - heights
of
the pure
de - light,
I
am sat - is - fied
to fol - low where He leads,
this I know,
have nothing then
to fear
if
my Lord
is
near,
