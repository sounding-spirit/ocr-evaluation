1 Time is a Stormy ocean,
5 To those who are spectators,
Beyond which Heaven lies,
What sorrows must ensue
We must brave its wild commotion,
To have their old companions
To enter Paradise.
To bid them a long adieu.
2 But vessels built by human skill,
6 But pleasures of a Paradise
Have never sailed afar.
No longer them invite
Till they are found run aground
'We'll sail while they rail,
On some dreadful sandy bar.
For we'll soon be out of sight."
3 The everlasting Gospel
7 " We are a band of sailors,
Has launched the deep at last,
In harmony and love,
Behold her sails suspended
The wind is in our favor,
Around the towering masts.
How joyfully we move."
4 And on her decks in order
The joyful sailors stand,
8 "About our future happiness,
There need be no debate,
Crying, "Oh here we go
To Immanuel's happy land."
While we ride on the tide
With our Captain and His Mate."
