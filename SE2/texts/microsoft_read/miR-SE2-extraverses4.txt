1.
I have found at last the Sav - iour,
Of
I have promised I would fol - low,
How
whom I've oft - en heard,
3. Christ is now my sum of pleas-ure,
ev - er rough the way,
Counting all things else but dross,
And I have the pre-cious fa - vor,
He has promised in His word :
Leaving all things of to - mor-row,
I will trust Him just to - day :
I have found my richest treas- ure,
round the sa - cred Cross :
CKEN
O, the joy that comes to me, . .. . And the pow'r that makes me free, . ...
For the morning doth ap - pear, . . . Which will banish ev - 'ry fear, . . ...
My
soul is sat - is - fied,
For - ev - er to
a - bide . . ..
to me,
me free,
My
soul is filled with praises, 'Tis the year of ju - bi - lee.
I shall see the land of Beu-lah, With my eyes undimmed by tears.
In thy cleft O Rock of A - ges, Where no harm can e'er be - tide.
Should the world in arms confront me, 5 By and by when war is over.
Though the bost of hell combine,
And the saints are gathering home,
In His name I'll win the vict'ry,
With His word the conqueror's sign.
In the presence of Jehovah,
Where the pilgrim ne'er shall roam:
Our Lord forever reigns,
My Jesus will be there,
And to His dazzling train,
His glory I shall share,
He has bound the fate of nations,
He will introduce my spirit,
And His kingdom He'll maintain.
To His Father as an heir.
