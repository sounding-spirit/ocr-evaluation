THE HEAVENLY UNION.
1-Com, saints and sinners, hear me
3-But when I hated all my sins,
tell,
My dear Redeemer took me in,
The wonders of Emmanuel,
And with His blood, He washed m
Who saved me from a burning hell
clean,
And brought my soul with Him to
And, oh, what seasons I have seen
dwell,
And gave me Heavenly Union.
Since first I found this Union.
2-When Jesus saw me from on high
4-I praised the Lord both night and
Beheld my soul in ruin lie,
day ,
It grieved me so that I must die.
I went from house to house to pray,
I strove salvation for to buy,
And if I met one on the way,
But still I found no Union.
I always found something to say
About the Heavenly Union.
5-I wonder why all saints don't sing
And make the heavenly arches ring,
And spread the news from poleto pole
'Till every nation has been told
About the Heavenly Union.

AWAY IN THE KINGDOM.
1-Come all oppressed and hear me
2-Of glorious liberty I'll sing,
tell
Away in the Kingdom.
Away in the Kingdom,
And make the heavenly arches ring,
That Jesus conquered death and hell,
Away in the Kingdom.
Away in the Kingdom.
He, all my prison bars did break,
He bought my pardon on the Tree,
Away in the Kingdom.
Away in the Kingdom.
My yoke of bondage He did take,
I'm glad to tell you now I'm free,
Away in the Kingdom.-Chorus.
Away in the Kingdom.

3-I all my sins on Him did lay,
Away in the Kingdom,
There's plenty of room.
There's
And this to me my Lord did say,
plenty of room,
Away in the Kingdom.
Away in the Kingdom.
"If you my mandates will obey,
There's plenty of room, my Jesus
Away in the Kingdom.

I'll give you a home with meto stay."
Away in the Kingdom.
Away in the Kingdom.-Chorus:
4-Lord, I believe a rest remains,
Away in the Kingdom.
A rest where pure enjoyment reigns,
Away in the Kingdom.
A rest where all our Soul's desire,
Away in the Kingdom,
Where fear and sin and grief expire,
Away in the Kingdom.-Chorus.
