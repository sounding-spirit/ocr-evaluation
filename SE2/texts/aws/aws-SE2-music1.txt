In your own way no lon-ger try, But let Him fix it

Take it to God in Je-sus' name, And He will fix it for you.
Gotalk with God,your hand in His, And He will fix it for
you.
At Je - sus' feet go lay it down And He will fix it for you.
Let Je-sus own and rule your heart And He will fix it
for
you.

Let
Je - sus fix it for you, He knows just what to do; When -
ev-er you pray, let Him have His way, And He will fix it for you.
