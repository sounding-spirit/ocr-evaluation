THE HEAVENLY UNION.
-Com, saints and sinners, hear me
-But when I hated all my sins,
tell,
My dear Redeemer took me in,
The wonders of Emmanuel,
And with His blood,H washed
Who saved me from a burning hell
clean,
And brought my soul with Him to
And, oh, what seasons I have seen
dwell,
Since first I found this Union.
And gave me Heavenly Union.
2When Jesus saw me from on high
4-1 praised the Lord both night ar
day,
Beheld my soul in ruin lie,
It grieved me SO that I must die.
I went from house to thouse to pra
I strove salvation for to buy,
And if T met one on the way,
Rut still I found no Union.
I always found something to say
About the Heavenly Union.
51 wonder why all saints don' sing
And make the heavenly arches ring,
And spread the news from pole to pole
Till every nation has been told
About the Heavenly Union.
