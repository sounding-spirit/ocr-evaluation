your guide,
3. When dis-cour-aged and for-sak-en for sak - en, Run to Him in pray'r,
4. If you chance to
find way,
a stran-g
Put him
in the
You may meet with many a dan ger, Ev 'ry-where you
go.
He is, though so
meek and low - ly,
More than
all be side.
Nev - er has been one o'er-tak-en en, Who re - sort - ed
there.
Tell him how to
flee the dan ger, While
it is called
day.
Don't for- get get that
God
a- bove you, Hath a gra - cious heart,
When the world in
arms
as- as-sa sail you, And your cour- age fail,
When the storms of
life
are beat-ing, beat- ing, Hard up - on your head,
Tell him there's a

He will nev - er cease to love you, Or to
take your part.
Let Him fight your bat - tle for you, And you

God will hide you, He is plead - ing, 'Be ye not a - fraid."
Je - sus Christ, on Cal-vary's mountain, Paid for A dam's fall.
5 Tell him that above a brother,
6 Then when Jesus comes in Glory,
There's a Saviour's love,
On the judgement throne,
If on earth he has no other,
In His book will be the story,
There's a friend above.
All shall be made known.
If he needs your help and kindness,
There above all other favors,
Don't withhold your hand,
On the golden strand,
Always of this be reminded,
Will be placed upon your labere
He's your fellow man.
For your fellow man.
