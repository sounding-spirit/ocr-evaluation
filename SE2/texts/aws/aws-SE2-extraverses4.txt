I have found at last the Sav - iour, Of
whom I've oft - en heard,

I have promised I would fol - low,
How
ev - er rough the way,
3. Christ is now my sum of pleas-ure, Counting all things else but dross,

And I have the pre-cious fa - vor,
He has promised in His word
Leav-ing all things of to - mor-row,
I
will trust Him just to - day
I have found my richest treas- ure,
A
- round the sa - ered Cross
0, the joy that comes to me,
And the pow'r that makes me free
For the morning doth ap - pear
Which will banish ev - 'ry fear
My soul is sat - is - fied,
For - ev - er to a - bide
to me,
me free,
My soul is filled with praises, Tis the year of ju - bi - lee.
I shall see
the land of Beu-lah, With my eyes undimmed by tearg.
In thy cleft 0
Rock of A - ges, Where no harm can e'er be - tide.
4 Should the world in arms confront me,
5 By and by when war is over.
Though the bost of hell conbine,
And the saints are gathering home,
In His name I'll win the viet'ry
In the presence of Jehovah,
With His word the conqueror's sign.
Where the pilgrim ne'er shall roam:
Our Lord forever reigns,
My Jesus will be there,
And to His dazzling train,
His glory I shall share,
He has bound the fate of nations,
He will introduce my spirit,
And His kingdom He'll maintain.
To His Father as an heir
