Beyond which Heaven les,
What gorrows Inust ensue
We must brave its wild commotion,
To have their old companions
To enter Paradise.

Has launched the deep at last,
In harmony and love,
Behold her sails suspended
The wind is in our favor,
Around the towering masts.

The joyful sailors stand,
There need be no debate,
Crying, Oh here we go
While we ride on the tide
To Immanuel's happy land.'
With our Captain and His Mate.'
