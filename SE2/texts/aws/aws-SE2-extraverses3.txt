5 When comforts of this world are few, 7 Sometimes the tempter tries his plans,
And friends are far away,
To make you go astray,
Remember always this is true,
But keep your hand in Jesus' hand,
The Lord will make the way.
And he will lead the way.
6 When hard and heavy is your load,
8 And when the dreary road you tread,
And not a single ray
Which leads to endless day,
Of light is shining on the road,
0 praise the Lord, there'l be no dread,
Just wait; there'll be a way.
For Christ will be the way.
