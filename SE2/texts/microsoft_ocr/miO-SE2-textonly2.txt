THE HEAVENLY UNION.
I—com, saints and sinners, hear me
tell ,
The wonders of Emmanuel,
Who saved me frcm•i a burning hell
And brought my soul with Him to
dwell,
And gave me Heavenly Union.
2-—When Jesus saw me from on high
Beheld my soul in ruin lie,
It grieved me so that I must die.
I strove salvation for to buy,
Bot still I found no Union.
3—But when I hated all my sins,
My dear Redeemer took me in,
And with His blood _ He washed mg
clean,
And, oh,. What seasons I have seen
first I found this Union.
4—1 praised the Lord both night ana
day,
I went fronf_house toihouse to pray,
And if I met one on the way,
I always found something to say
About the Heavenly Union.
5—1 wonder why all saints don't sing
And make the heavenly arches ring,
And spread the news frompole to pole
'Till every nation has been told
About the Heavenly Union.

AWAY IN THE KINGDOM.
I—Come all and hear me
tell
Away in the Kingdom,
That Jesus conquered death and hell,
way in the Kingdom.
He bought my pardon on the Tree,
Away in the Kingdom.
I'm glad to tell you now I'm free,
Away in the Kingdom,
CHORUS.
There's plenty of room. There's
plenty of room,
Away in the Kingdom.
There's plenty of room, my Jesus
says,
Away in the Kingdom.

Away in the Kingdom.
And make the heavenly arches ring,
Away in the Kingdom.

Wha•e fear and sin and grief expire,
Away in the Kingdom.—Chorus.
