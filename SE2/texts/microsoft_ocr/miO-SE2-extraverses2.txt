Time is a soormy ocean,
Beyond which Heaven lies,
We inust brave its wild commotion,
To enter Paradise.
But vessels built by human skill,
Have never sailed afar.
Till they are found run aground
On some dreadful sandy bar.
The evenastilig Gospel
Has launched the deep at last,
Behold her sails suspended
Around the towering masts.
And on her decks in order
The joyful stand,
Crying, ' 'Oh here we go
To Immanuel's happy land."

What sorrows must ensue
To have their old companions
To bid them a long adieu.
But pleasures of a Paradise
No longer them invite
We'll sail while they rail,
For we'll soon be out of sight."
We are a band of sailors,
In harmony and love,
The wind is in our favor,
How joyfully we move.
"About our future happiness,
There need be no debate,
While we ride on the tide
With our Captain and His Mate."
