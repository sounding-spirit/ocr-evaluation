HE SAVED ME
was once far away from the
Saviour,
And His face was not smiling on me;
wonder if Christ the Redeemer,
Would save a poor sinner like me.
-—1 was long in that sad night of
darkness,
Not a br{ght ray of light could I see;
This thought filled my poor heart
with sadness,
No hope for a poor sinner like me.
—But there in that dark lonely hotli/,
Came a voice sweetly whispering
to me,
Saying, Christ the Redeemerhath,
power
To save a poor sinner like me.
—I listened, and 10! 'twas the
Saviour,
Then speaking so kindly to me;
And now unto others I am telling;
How he saved a poor sinner like me.
—I then fully trusted in Jesus
And oh, what a joy cam t me;
My beart it was filled wit His
praises,
For saving sin er like me.

HOME OF THE SOUL
will sing you a song of that
beautif@l land,
That far away. home of the soul,
Where no storms over beat on tho
glittering strand
While the years of eternity roll.
CHORUS
I have anchor my soul in tho
haven of rest
T will safl the wide seas no more,
The tempest may sweep o'er tho
wild stormy deep,
In Jesus I am safe for ever more,
2—0, that home of the soul in •y
visions and dreams,
Its bright Jasper walls I can see,
Till I fancy but thinly the veil inter•
venes
Beneath the fair city and me.
3—That unchangeable home is for
you and for me,
Where Jesus of Nazareth stands;
The king of all kingdoms forever is
He,
And He holdeth our crowns in His
hands.
4—0 how sweet it will be in
beautiful land,
So free from all sorrow and pain:
With songs on our lips and with
harps in our hands,
To meet one another again.

"Almost persuaded" Christ to re-
ceive.
Seems now some soul to say,
Go, Spirit, go thy way,
Some more convenient day
On Thee I'll call.
2 ' 'Almost persuaded," come, come
today;
"Almost persuaded}" turn not
away;
Jesus invites you here,
Angels are lingering near,
Prayers rise from hearts so- dear;
' 'C) come.'

past:
'Almost persuaded)" doom comes
at last!
' 'Almost" can not avail;
'Almost" is but to fail
Sad, sad that bitter wail.
' 'Almost—but lost!"
