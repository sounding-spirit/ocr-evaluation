And I have the pre-cious fa - vor,
Leav-iug all things of to - mor-row„

Counting all things else but dross,

My
soul is filled with praises, YTis the year of ju - bl
I shall see the land of Beu-lah, With my eyes undimmed by
In thy cleft O Rock of A- ges, Where no harm can e'er be
4 Should the world in arms confront me,
Though the bost of hell combine,
In His name I'll win the vict'ry,
With His word the conqueror's sign.
Our Lord forever reigns,
And to His dazzling train,
Be has bound tbe fate of nations,
And His kingdom He'll maintain.
5 By and by when war is over.
And the saints are gathering home,
In the presence of Jehovah,
Where the pilgrim ne'er shall roam:
My Jesus will be there,
His glory I shall share,
He will introduce my spirit,
To His Father as an heir;
