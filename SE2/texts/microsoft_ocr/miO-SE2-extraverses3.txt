4. But when you find you can't do more, You plans mu*t all' de lay,
Are rough; the path is hard to find, But God will make the way.

If you can on - ly trust and wait, Th√© Lord will make the way.
5 When comforts of this world are few, 7 Sometimes the tempter tries his plans,
And friends are far away,
Remember always this is true,
The Lord will make the way.
6 When hard and heavy is your load,
And not a single ray
Of light is shining on the road,
Just wait; there'll be a way.
Copyright, 1901,
To make you go astruy,
But keep your hand in Jesus' hand,
And he will lead the way.
8 And when the dreary road you tread,
Which leads to endless day,
O praise the Lord, there'll be no dread.
For Christ will be the way.
