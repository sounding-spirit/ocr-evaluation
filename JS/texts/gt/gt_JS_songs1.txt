No. 25. He's the Lord of Lords.

Why, He's the Lord of lords, And the King of kings, Why

Je-sus Christ is the first and the last, No one can work like Him.

1. I will not let you go, my Lord ; No one can work like Him, Un-

til you come and bless my soul, No one can work like Him.

2. For Paul and Silas bound in jail,
	No one can work like Him ;
   The Christian prayed both night and day,
	No one can work like him.
       Cho.--Why, He's the Lord of lords &c.

3. I wish those mourners would believe.
	No one can work like Him,
   That Jesus is ready to receive,
	No one can work like Him.
	  Cho.--Why, He's the Lord or lords, &c.
