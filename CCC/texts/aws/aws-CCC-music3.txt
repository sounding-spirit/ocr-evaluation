Oh.
say can you see by the dawn's early light, Whatso proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
:
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thro the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were So gallantly streaming
2.
On the shore dim-ly seen thro' the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silencer re - pos es,
Whatis that which the breeze,o'e the towering steep, As it fit-ful-ly blows,hall eon-ceals,hal dis-elos
es
3.
Oh,
thus be it ev er when freeman shall stand Between their loved homes and the war's deso - la-tion
Blest with viet'ry and peaee,ma the heav' n-rescued land Praise the pow'r that has made and preserved us a nation.
And the rocket's red glare,the bombs bursting in air. Gave proof thro' the nightthat our flag was still there.
Now it eatches the gleain, of the morning's first beam, In full glo - ry re - flected.ne now shines o'er the stream.
Then conquer we must, whenoul our cause it is just, And this be our mot-to," In God is our trust
CHoRus.
Oh,
say does that Star-span-gled Ban-Der yet
wave O'er the land of the freeandthe home of the brave!
"Tisthe Star-span-gled Banner Oh, long may it
wave O'er the land of the freeand the home of the brave
And the Star-span-gled Banner in
tri umph shall
wave O'erthe land of
the
freeand the home of the brave.
