Oh,
how
sad
to
part with loved
ones,
Whom
du
ty
calls
a
way,
2. Some are
on
the
O - c
sail
ing,
Some in
dis
tant lands do
roam ;
3. Oth - ers
gone,
for . ev - er
gone,
On
that
ev
er
on - ward track,

And
we know
that
ere
we
see
them,
We
will
watch
for many
a
day
Some have
gone
to
seek their
for
tunes
In
dis
tant west - ern
home;
Where the
trav
ler
wea - ry
trav
'ler
Goes
and
nev
er - more comes back;
9:5
DUET.
But
we
hope
a
gain to
meet
them,
This
thought
dis
pels the
pain,
Oh,
the
anx
ious
long
May
it
not
be
all in
vain,
In
that
and
of
wait- ing,
an - gel
cho
ing,
irs,
Where the
heav'n - ly
hosts do
reign,
