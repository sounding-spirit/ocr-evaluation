Where
swing-ing,

Where
so oft our hearts

Where the pine-tree boughs are swinging,
In the balmy southern breeze;
Where so oft our hearts have blended,
In the earnest heart-felt pray'r ;
Where the pine-tree boughs are swinging,
In the balmy southern breeze.
And
the birds are sweet, -
sing- ing,
the

That
their home a - mong
in heav'n when life
end - ed,
We may meet our

And
the birds are sweet

In their home a - mong

And the birds are sweet-ly singing,
In their home among the trees.
That in heav'n when life is end-ed,
We may meet our darling there
And the birds are sweet-ly singing.
In their home among the trees.
