40 WHEN THEY ALL COME BACK AGAIN.

J.C. BUSHEY.	F. P. MORRIS.

QUARTET.

1. Oh, how sad to part with loved ones, Whom du - ty calls a - way,
2. Some are on the o - cean sail - ing, Some in dis - tant lands do roam;
3. Oth - ers gone, for - ev - er gone, On that ev - er on - ward track,

And we know that ere we see them, We will watch for many a day;
Some have gone to seek their for - tunes In a dis - tant west - ern home;
Where the trav - ’ler, wea - ry trav - ’ler Goes and nev - er - more comes back;

DUET	3	3

But we hope a - gain to meet them, This thought dis - pels the pain,
Oh, the anx - ious wait- ing, long - ing, May it not be all in vain,
In that land of an - gel - cho - irs, Where the heav’n - ly hosts do reign,
