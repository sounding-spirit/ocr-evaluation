THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER. Words by FRANCIS S. KEY. 43

All the Voices in Unison.

1. { Oh, say can you see, by the dawn’s early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming;
	Whose broad stripes and bright stars thro’ the perilous fight,O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming;
2. { On the shore dim-ly seen thro’ the mists of the deep, Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence re - pos-es,
	What is that which the breeze,o’er the towering steep, As it fi-ful- ly blows,half con-ceals,half dis-clos-es?
3. { Oh, thus be it ev - er when freemen shall stand Between their loved homes and the war's deso - la-tion;
	Blest with vict’ry and peace,may the heav’n-rescued land Praise the pow’r that has made and preserved us a nation.

And the rocket's red glare,the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof thro’ the night that our flag was still there.
Now it catches the gleam, of the morning’s first beam, In full glo - ry re - flected,now shines o’er the stream.
Then conquer we must,when our cause it is just, And this be our mot-to, “In God is our trust;”

CHORUS.

Oh, say does that Star-span-gled Ban-ner yet wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

’Tis the Star-span-gled Banner!Oh, long may it wave O’er the land of the free and the home the brave!

And the Star-span-gled Banner in tri- umph shall wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
