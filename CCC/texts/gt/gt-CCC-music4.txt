LEAD ME WHERE SHE’S SLEEPING, Concluded,	53

Where the pine - tree boughs are swing-ing, 	In the balm - y south - ern breeze;
Where so oft our hearts have blend-ed, 		In the ear - nest heart - felt pray’r;
Where the pine - tree boughs are swing-ing, 	In the balm - y south - ern breeze;

Where the pine-tree boughs are swing-ing, 	In the balmy southern breeze;
Where so oft our hearts have blended, 		In the earnest heart-felt pray’r;
Where the pine-tree boughs are swinging, 	In the balmy southern breeze;

And the birds are sweet - ly sing- ing, 	In their home a - mong the trees.
That in heav’n when life is end - ed, 		We may meet out dar - ling there.
And the birds are sweet - ly sing- ing		In their home a - mong the trees.

And the birds are sweet-ly singing, 		In their home among the trees.
That in heav’n when life is end - ed, 		We may meet out darling there.
And the birds are sweet-ly singing		In their home among the trees.
