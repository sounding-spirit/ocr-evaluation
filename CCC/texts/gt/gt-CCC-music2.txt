WHEN THEY ALL COME BACK AGAIN. Concluded. 41

SEMI-CHORUS.

And we fond - ly view the fu - ture, When they all come back a - gain.
Speed the hap - py hour of meet - ing, When they all come back a - gain.
We will strike glad hands for - ev - er, Be u - nit - ed all a - gain. 

FULL-CHORUS.

When they all	    come back a - gain, When they all come back a - gain;
	When they all come back a - gain,  When they all come back a - again.

Oh, the grand and glo - rious meet - ing, When they all come back a - gain.
