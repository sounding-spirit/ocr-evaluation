THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER
Warda by FRANCIS S. ELY. 43
An the Voices in Unison.
Oh,
od os
say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming:
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thro' the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming :
On the shore dim-ly seen thro' the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence re - pos-es,
What is that which the breeze,o'er the towering steep, As it fit-fui-ly blows,half con-ceals, half disclos-es ?
Oh, thus be it ev - er when freeman shall stand Between their loved homes and the war's deso. la-tion:
Blest with vict'ry and peace,may the heav'n-rescued land Praise the pow'r that has made and preserved us a nation.
And the rocket's red glare,the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
Now it catches the gleain, of the morning's first beam, In full glo - ry re â€¢ flected, now shines o'er the stream.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our mot-to, "In God is our trust :*
CHORUS.

Oh,
say does that Star-span-gled Ban-per yet
wave O'er the land of the
free and the home of the brave!
"Tis the Star-span-gled Banner! Oh, long may it
wave O'er the land of the
mo
free and the home of the brave!
And the Star-span-gled Banner in
trl- umph shall
wave O'er the land of the
free and the home of the brave.
